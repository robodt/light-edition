### Robodt structure

Everything you'll need to get started with your own website is put in the 'site' directory. The index.php handles all websites requests this file also contains the location for your site folder. All components are being handled by [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), those settings are saved in composer.json and composer.lock. The installed components are installed in 'vendor'. You can edit composer.json, but it's important that you don't edit composer.lock or anything inside 'vendor'!


### Edit content

In the site/content folder all content is located. Every page has it's own folder, with an optional numeric prefix to sort the navigation order (separated by a dot). The page's content is put in index.txt starting with some optional metadata:

- title: The title of the current page
- navigation (optional): Navigation label
- url (optional): Url/uri overwrite for custom url's, required and empty for homepage
- status (optional): Statuscode which can be 404 for an error page
- hidden (optional): Set value 'true' to hide this page from the navigation
- custom: It's also possible to put your own keys and values here, which will be available in the page template

The metadata separated by '----' with some empty lines from the content itself.

Note: Please don't remove site/content/404 which handles your 404 error page, needed when a page can not be found. Just edit the contents of site/content/404/index.txt to make it your own.


### Theme your website

All theme related files are located at site/theme. The main file is template.php, this file will be loaded by Robodt, so it's important this file exists! Of course you can separate stuff like header and footer by using includes. For reference please look at the current theme, more documentation and features will be available in the feature.


### Settings

Settings of the site can be found in site/settings/settings.php and will be available within Robodt and also in the theme. There is an example included.
